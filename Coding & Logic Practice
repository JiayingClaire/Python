1. for loop
1) Associate True with the variable "is_ascending" if the list numbers is in ascending order. 
Otherwise, associate False with "is_ascending".

is_ascending = True
for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
  if numbers[i] < numbers[i-1]:
      is_ascending = False

2) Given a positive integer n, assign True to "is_prime" if n has no factors other than 1 and itself.

is_prime = True
for i in range(2, n):
  if n%i == 0:
      is_prime = False

2. while loop and it's sentinel
You work for a bakery that sells two items: muffins and cupcakes. The number of muffins and cupcakes in your shop 
at any given time is stored in the variables muffins and cupcakes, which have been defined for you. 
Write a program that takes strings from standard input indicating what your customers are buying
("muffin" for a muffin, "cupcake" for a cupcake). If they buy a muffin, decrease muffins by one, 
and if they buy a cupcake, decrease cupcakes by 1. If there is no more of that baked good left, print ("Out of stock"). 
Once you are done selling, input "0", and have the program print out the number of muffins and cupcakes remaining, 
in the form "muffins: 9 cupcakes: 3" (if there were 9 muffins and 3 cupcakes left, for example).

order = input()
while order != "0":
  if order == "muffin":
      if muffins > 0:
          muffins -= 1
      else: print("Out of stock")
  elif order == "cupcake":
      if cupcakes > 0:
          cupcakes -= 1
      else: print("Out of stock")
  order = input()   # always remember to put the sentinel here!
print("muffins: ", muffins, "cupcakes: ", cupcakes)
